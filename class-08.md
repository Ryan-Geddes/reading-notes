#### HTML Chapter 15: Layout p.358-404
- `<div>` elements are often used as containing elements to group together sections of a page.  
- Browsers display pages in normal flow unless you specify relative, absolute or fixed positioning
- The float property moves content to the left or right of the page and can be used to create multi-column layouts.  Floated items require a definted width. 
    * you ca also use the clear property which makes it so that nothing to the values-left, right, top, bottom of the element touches.  This helps when there are varying heights of elements 
- Pages can be fixed width or liquid aka stretchy, layouts. 
    * when using liquid you end up using percentages in the CSS to keep things coordinated
- Designers keep pages within 960-1000 pixels wide, and indicate what the site is about within the top 600 pixels.  This demonstrates its relevance without scrolling.
    * page 389 & 390 show possible 960 pixel wide 12 column grid layouts
- Grids help create professional and flexible designs. 
- CSS Frameworks provide rules for common tasks. 
- You can include multiple CSS files in one page. 
    * using @import or linking multiple css to the HTML.
