#### HTML Ch. 6: Tables pp. 126-145
- The `<table>` element is used to add tables to a web page. 
- A table is drawn out row by row.  Each row is created with the `<tr>` element 
- Inside each row there are a number of cells represented by the `<td>` element.  Or, the `<th>` element if it is a header
- You can make cells of a table span more than one row or column using the rowspan and colspan attributes 
- For long tables you can split the table into a `<thead>` `<tbody>` and `<tfoot>`


#### JS Ch. 3: Functions, Methods, Objects pp. 106-144
- An object is a series of variables and function that represent something from the world aorund you. 
- In an object, variables are known as properties of he object; functions are known as methods of the object. 
    * Update the value of properties in an object using dot notation
    * Constructor notation use a function as a template for creating objects p. 110 
- Web browsers implement objects that reprsent both the browser window and the document loaded into the browser window. 
- JavaScript also have several built in objects such as String, Number, Math and Date.  Their properties and methods offer functionality that help you write scripts. 
    * Using built in objects there are three kinds: 
        - Browser Object Model p. 124
        - Document Object Model p. 126
        - Global JavaScript Objects p. 128
- Arrays and objects can be used to create complex data sets and both can contain the other. 

*Arrays are special kinds of objects* 

You can combine arrays and objects to create complex data structures. *Arrays can store a series of objects (and remember their order).  Objects can also hold arrays (as values of their properties). **THIS SEEMS VERY SALMON COOKIES**
